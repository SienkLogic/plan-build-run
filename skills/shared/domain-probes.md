# Domain-Aware Probing Patterns

Shared reference for `/dev:explore`, `/dev:begin`, and `/dev:discuss`.

When the user mentions a technology area, use these probes to ask insightful follow-up questions. Don't run through them as a checklist — pick the 2-3 most relevant based on context. The goal is to surface hidden assumptions and trade-offs the user may not have considered yet.

## Authentication

| User mentions | Agent probes with domain knowledge |
|---|---|
| "login" or "auth" | OAuth (which providers?), JWT, or session-based? Do you need social login or just email/password? |
| "users" or "accounts" | MFA required? Password reset flow? Email verification? |
| "sessions" | Session duration and refresh strategy? Server-side sessions or stateless tokens? |
| "roles" or "permissions" | RBAC, ABAC, or simple role checks? How many distinct roles? |
| "API keys" | Key rotation strategy? Scoped permissions per key? Rate limiting per key? |
