# Plan 14-05: Update All Cross-References in SKILL.md Files

Update 5 cross-references across 4 SKILL.md files to point to the new `references/` directory paths instead of the old scattered locations in `skills/` subdirectories. This plan depends on 14-01 (which moves the files).

<task id="14-05-T1" type="auto" tdd="false">
  <name>Update cross-references in build/SKILL.md and status/SKILL.md</name>
  <files>
    plugins/dev/skills/build/SKILL.md
    plugins/dev/skills/status/SKILL.md
  </files>
  <action>
1. In `plugins/dev/skills/build/SKILL.md`:
   - Line 446: Change `skills/build/continuation-format.md` to `references/continuation-format.md`
     - Old: `Reference: \`skills/build/continuation-format.md\` for the continuation protocol.`
     - New: `Reference: \`references/continuation-format.md\` for the continuation protocol.`
   - Line 538: Change `skills/plan/verification-patterns.md` to `references/verification-patterns.md`
     - Old: `See skills/plan/verification-patterns.md for detailed patterns.`
     - New: `See references/verification-patterns.md for detailed patterns.`
   - Search the rest of the file for any other references to old paths (grep for `skills/build/commit-conventions` or `skills/plan/deviation-rules` etc.)

2. In `plugins/dev/skills/status/SKILL.md`:
   - Line 188: Change `skills/shared/ui-formatting.md` to `references/ui-formatting.md`
     - Old: `Use indicators from \`skills/shared/ui-formatting.md\`:`
     - New: `Use indicators from \`references/ui-formatting.md\`:`
   - Search the rest of the file for any other references to old paths

build/SKILL.md has 2 updated cross-references pointing to references/ directory. status/SKILL.md has 1 updated cross-reference pointing to references/ directory. No old scattered-path references remain in either file.

  <name>Update cross-references in begin/SKILL.md and quick/SKILL.md</name>

    plugins/dev/skills/quick/SKILL.md
  </files>
  <action>
1. In `plugins/dev/skills/begin/SKILL.md`:
   - Line 59: Change `skills/begin/questioning-guide.md` to `references/questioning.md` (note the rename)
     - Old: `**Reference**: Read \`skills/begin/questioning-guide.md\` for technique details.`
     - New: `**Reference**: Read \`references/questioning.md\` for technique details.`
   - Search the rest of the file for any other references to `questioning-guide` or old paths

2. In `plugins/dev/skills/quick/SKILL.md`:
   - Line 86: Change `skills/quick/templates/plan-format.md.tmpl` to `references/plan-format.md`
     - Old: `Read \`skills/quick/templates/plan-format.md.tmpl\` for the plan file format.`
     - New: `Read \`references/plan-format.md\` for the plan file format.`
   - Note: The quick skill's plan-format was a template (.md.tmpl) referencing the format spec. The canonical reference doc is now `references/plan-format.md`. The skill-local template at `skills/quick/templates/plan-format.md.tmpl` should be deleted since the reference doc replaces it.
   - Delete `plugins/dev/skills/quick/templates/plan-format.md.tmpl` after updating the reference
   - If the `skills/quick/templates/` directory is now empty, delete it

3. Do a final sweep: search ALL files in `plugins/dev/skills/` and `plugins/dev/agents/` for any remaining references to the 7 old paths:
   - `skills/build/continuation-format`
   - `skills/build/commit-conventions`
   - `skills/plan/verification-patterns`
   - `skills/plan/deviation-rules`
   - `skills/plan/plan-format`
   - `skills/shared/ui-formatting`
   - `skills/begin/questioning-guide`
   - `skills/begin/questioning`
   - `skills/quick/templates/plan-format`
   If any are found, update them to the corresponding `references/` path.

  <done>
begin/SKILL.md and quick/SKILL.md cross-references updated to references/ directory. The obsolete `skills/quick/templates/plan-format.md.tmpl` is deleted. No SKILL.md or agent file references any old scattered doc path.
