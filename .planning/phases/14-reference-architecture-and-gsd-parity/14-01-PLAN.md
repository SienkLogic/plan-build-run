# Plan 14-01: Move Scattered Reference Docs to references/ Directory

Move 7 cross-cutting reference documents from their current scattered locations in `skills/` subdirectories into a centralized `references/` directory. This is a pure file-move operation with one rename (`questioning-guide.md` -> `questioning.md`).

<task id="14-01-T1" type="auto" tdd="false">
  <name>Create references/ directory and move 7 reference docs</name>
  <files>
    plugins/dev/references/continuation-format.md
    plugins/dev/references/verification-patterns.md
    plugins/dev/references/ui-formatting.md
    plugins/dev/references/questioning.md
    plugins/dev/references/commit-conventions.md
    plugins/dev/references/deviation-rules.md
    plugins/dev/references/plan-format.md
  </files>
  <action>
1. Create directory `plugins/dev/references/`
2. Copy the following files to `plugins/dev/references/`, preserving content exactly:
   - `plugins/dev/skills/build/continuation-format.md` -> `plugins/dev/references/continuation-format.md`
   - `plugins/dev/skills/plan/verification-patterns.md` -> `plugins/dev/references/verification-patterns.md`
   - `plugins/dev/skills/shared/ui-formatting.md` -> `plugins/dev/references/ui-formatting.md`
   - `plugins/dev/skills/begin/questioning-guide.md` -> `plugins/dev/references/questioning.md` (RENAMED: drop "-guide" suffix)
   - `plugins/dev/skills/build/commit-conventions.md` -> `plugins/dev/references/commit-conventions.md`
   - `plugins/dev/skills/plan/deviation-rules.md` -> `plugins/dev/references/deviation-rules.md`
   - `plugins/dev/skills/plan/plan-format.md` -> `plugins/dev/references/plan-format.md`
3. Content must be byte-identical to source files (except `questioning.md` which is renamed from `questioning-guide.md` but content is unchanged)

1. Delete the 7 original files from their scattered locations:

   - `plugins/dev/skills/begin/questioning-guide.md`
2. Verify that only SKILL.md (and templates/ subdirs) remain in each affected skill directory.
   - `skills/build/` should retain: `SKILL.md`, `templates/`
   - `skills/plan/` should retain: `SKILL.md`, `decimal-phase-calc.md`, `templates/`
   - `skills/shared/` should retain: `domain-probes.md`, `phase-argument-parsing.md`
   - `skills/begin/` should retain: `SKILL.md`, `templates/`
