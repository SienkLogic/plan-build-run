title: "Gap analysis: Towline references vs GSD references"
status: pending

## Goal

Review GSD's reference documents and identify what Towline needs to add or rebuild.

## Research Source

- GSD references: https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done/tree/main/get-shit-done/references
- Towline's existing references: `plugins/dev/references/`

## Tasks

1. Catalog all GSD reference documents with their purpose
2. Map each GSD reference to its Towline equivalent (if one exists)
3. Identify gaps — GSD references with no Towline counterpart
4. For each gap, assess whether Towline needs it or covers the content elsewhere
5. For references we should add, note what skills/agents consume them
6. Check if any existing Towline references need content upgrades

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete mapping of GSD references to Towline references
- [ ] Gap list with priority and rationale for each
- [ ] Recommendations for new references with brief content descriptions
- [ ] Notes on existing references that need updates
