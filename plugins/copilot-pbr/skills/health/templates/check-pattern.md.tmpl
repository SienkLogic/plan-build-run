# Health Check Execution Pattern

Each of the 9 checks follows this common pattern. The check-specific details (what to read, what to validate, what constitutes PASS/FAIL) are defined in SKILL.md — this template describes only the shared execution flow.

## Pattern

```
For check {check_number} ({check_name}):

1. READ — Read the target file(s): {target_files}
2. VALIDATE — Apply the check-specific rules: {validation_rules}
3. CLASSIFY — Determine result:
   - PASS: Validation succeeded, no issues found
   - FAIL: A required condition is violated (counts toward issue total)
   - WARN: A recommended condition is violated (does NOT count toward issue total)
   - INFO: Informational note, not a problem
4. RECORD — Store the result with:
   - Status: [PASS], [FAIL], [WARN], or [INFO]
   - Check name (short label)
   - One-line summary of finding
   - For FAIL/WARN: the specific file, the problem, and a concrete fix suggestion
```

## Rules

- Every check MUST produce exactly one status line (PASS, FAIL, WARN, or INFO)
- FAIL results MUST include: file path, problem description, and fix suggestion
- Multiple failures within a single check produce multiple entries in the "Issues Found" section
- Checks never auto-repair — they report only
- If a check depends on a prior check's file (e.g., Check 2 needs config.json which Check 1 validates exists), and that file is missing, report the dependency failure and move on
