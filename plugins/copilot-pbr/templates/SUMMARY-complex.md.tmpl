## Body Structure

```markdown
# Plan Summary: {plan_id}

## What Was Built

{2-3 paragraph description of what was accomplished}

## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Options Considered | Chosen | Rationale |
|----------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| {decision} | {opt1}, {opt2} | {chosen} | {why} |

## Task Results

| Task | Status | Commit | Files | Verify |
|------|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| {task_id}: {name} | done | {hash} | {count} | passed |

## Key Implementation Details

{Important details about HOW things were implemented}

## Integration Points

{How this plan connects to other plans - imports, exports, shared state}

## Known Issues

{Issues discovered during execution}

## Dependencies Provided

{What other plans can now depend on}

## Deferred Items

{Items noticed but intentionally deferred - with rationale}
```

## Selection Heuristic

Use this template when ANY of the following are true:
- Key architectural decisions were made during execution
- Total files created or modified > 6
- Deviations from the plan occurred
- Multiple integration points were established
- The plan touched shared infrastructure or patterns
