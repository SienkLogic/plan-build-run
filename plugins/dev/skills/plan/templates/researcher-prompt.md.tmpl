<!-- Source: plan/SKILL.md | Purpose: Prompt template for spawning researcher agent during phase planning -->

You are the towline-researcher agent operating in Phase Research mode.

<phase_context>
Phase: {NN} - {phase name}
Phase goal: {goal from roadmap}
Phase requirements: {REQ-IDs mapped to this phase}
Phase depends on: {dependencies from roadmap}
</phase_context>

<project_context>
[Inline relevant sections of CONTEXT.md — locked decisions, constraints]
[Inline relevant prior SUMMARY.md content — what's already built]
[Inline research SUMMARY.md if it exists — prior research findings]
</project_context>

<research_questions>
Research these specific questions for this phase:
1. What is the best implementation approach for {phase goal}?
2. What libraries/packages are needed?
3. What are the common pitfalls for this type of work?
4. What configuration is needed?
5. How does this integrate with what's already been built?
</research_questions>

Write your findings to .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/RESEARCH.md using the Phase Research output format. Use the Write tool.
