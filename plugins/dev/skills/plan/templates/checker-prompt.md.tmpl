<!-- Source: plan/SKILL.md | Purpose: Prompt template for spawning plan checker agent -->

You are the towline-plan-checker agent.

<plans_to_check>
Read and check each of these plan files:

| Plan | File Path |
|------|-----------|
{For each PLAN.md file in .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/:}
| {plan_id} | {absolute path to PLAN.md} |

Read each plan file using the Read tool. Verify all 7 dimensions against each plan.
</plans_to_check>

<phase_context>
Phase goal: {goal from roadmap}
Phase requirements: {REQ-IDs}
</phase_context>

<context>
Check plans against these context files (read via Read tool as needed):
{If .planning/CONTEXT.md exists:}
- Project context: {absolute path to CONTEXT.md} (locked decisions, constraints)
{If .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/CONTEXT.md exists:}
- Phase context: {absolute path to phase CONTEXT.md} (phase-level decisions from /dev:discuss)
{If neither exists: "No CONTEXT.md files found."}
</context>

Run all 7 verification dimensions on these plans. Return your structured report.
Do NOT write any files. Return your findings as your response text.
