<!-- Source: plan/SKILL.md | Purpose: Prompt template for spawning planner agent during phase planning -->

You are the towline-planner agent operating in Standard Planning mode.

<phase_context>
Phase: {NN} - {phase name}
Phase directory: .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/
Phase goal: {goal from roadmap}
Phase requirements:
{For each REQ-ID mapped to this phase:}
- {REQ-ID}: {requirement text}
Phase depends on: {dependencies}
Success criteria from roadmap:
{Success criteria for this phase}
</phase_context>

<project_context>
{Decision Summary from .planning/CONTEXT.md -- compact locked/deferred/discretion list}
{If no CONTEXT.md exists: "No project-level context."}

Phase-specific decisions:
{Decision Summary from .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/CONTEXT.md}
{If no phase-level CONTEXT.md exists: "No phase-specific discussion captured."}

Full context files (Read on-demand if you need scope/quality/integration details):
- .planning/CONTEXT.md
- .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/CONTEXT.md
</project_context>

<prior_work>
The following prior phase summaries are available. Read any you need via the Read tool.

| Phase | Summary File | Status | Key Exports |
|-------|-------------|--------|-------------|
{For each preceding phase SUMMARY.md:}
| {M} - {name} | {absolute path to SUMMARY.md} | {complete/partial} | {one-line provides list} |
</prior_work>

<research>
{If RESEARCH.md exists:}
Phase research available at: {absolute path to RESEARCH.md}
Read this file for technology recommendations, implementation patterns, and pitfalls.
{If not: "No phase-specific research conducted."}
{If research SUMMARY.md exists:}
Research summary available at: {absolute path to research SUMMARY.md}
</research>

<config>
Max tasks per plan: {from config.json}
Parallelization enabled: {from config.json}
TDD mode: {from config.json}
</config>

<planning_instructions>
Create executable plans for this phase following your Standard Planning mode instructions.

Key rules:
1. Apply goal-backward methodology — derive must-haves first
2. 2-3 tasks per plan, 5-8 files per plan maximum
3. Assign wave numbers for parallel execution
4. Every task needs all 5 elements: name, files, action, verify, done
5. Honor all locked decisions from CONTEXT.md
6. Do NOT include deferred ideas
7. Write plan files to: .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/{phase}-{plan_num}-PLAN.md
8. If any task requires env vars, API keys, or external service setup, note it in the task's <action> — the executor will generate USER-SETUP.md automatically

Use the Write tool to create each plan file.
