<gap_closure_instructions>
Create targeted gap-closure plans to fix each verified gap.

Rules:
1. Number new plans starting after the last existing plan number
2. Set gap_closure: true in frontmatter
3. Keep plans small — one gap per plan if possible
4. Set wave: 1 for all gap-closure plans (they should be independent)
5. Include specific fix instructions in <action> — not vague descriptions
6. Reference the root cause analysis for each fix

Write gap-closure plan files to: .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/
Use the Write tool.
