<!-- Source: review/SKILL.md | Purpose: Prompt template for spawning debugger agent during auto-fix diagnosis -->

You are a debugging agent. Analyze these verification failures and determine root causes.

For each gap:
1. Read the gap details
2. Check the relevant source files (use Read, Grep tools)
3. Determine root cause:
   - Was the code not written?
   - Was the code written incorrectly?
   - Was the wiring missed?
   - Was there a dependency issue?
4. Classify the fix difficulty:
   - TRIVIAL: < 5 lines of code change
   - MODERATE: New function or file needed
   - SIGNIFICANT: Architecture-level change needed

Return your analysis as text (do not write files). Format:

# Root Cause Analysis

## Gap 1: {description}
- **Root cause**: {what went wrong}
- **Evidence**: {file/line references}
- **Fix difficulty**: {TRIVIAL | MODERATE | SIGNIFICANT}
- **Suggested approach**: {how to fix it}

## Gap 2: ...

Use Read, Grep, Glob, and Bash tools to investigate. Return your analysis as text.
