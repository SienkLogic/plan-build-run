# USER-SETUP.md Template

> Referenced by: towline-executor agent
> Generated automatically when a plan introduces external setup requirements.
> Append to existing file if it already exists (do not overwrite).

## Structure

```markdown
# User Setup: Phase {NN}

> Generated by plan: {plan_id}
> Last updated: {date}

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose | How to Get |
|----------|----------|---------|------------|
| {VAR_NAME} | YES/NO | {what it does} | {where to get the value} |

## Account Setup

| Service | Required For | Setup Steps |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| {e.g., Discord Developer Portal} | {OAuth login} | 1. Go to {URL} 2. Create app 3. Copy credentials |

## System Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Install Command |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| {e.g., ffmpeg} | {>=5.0} | {platform-specific install command} |

## Verification Commands

Run these to confirm setup is complete:

```

## Rules

- If `USER-SETUP.md` already exists from a prior plan, APPEND — do not overwrite
- Only include items requiring USER action (not auto-installed dependencies)
- Reference the plan ID that introduced each requirement
- If no external setup was needed, do NOT create the file
