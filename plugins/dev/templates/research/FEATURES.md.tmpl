# Feature Research

**Domain:** {domain}
**Researched:** {date}
**Confidence:** {confidence}

## Feature Landscape

### Table Stakes (Users Expect These)

Features users assume exist. Missing these = product feels incomplete.

| Feature | Why Expected | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|--------------|------------|-------|
| {feature} | {expectation} | {complexity} | {notes} |

### Differentiators (Competitive Advantage)

Features that set the product apart. Not required, but valuable.

| Feature | Value Proposition | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| {feature} | {value} | {complexity} | {notes} |

### Anti-Features (Commonly Requested, Often Problematic)

Features that seem good but create problems.

| Feature | Why Requested | Why Problematic | Alternative |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| {feature} | {appeal} | {problems} | {alternative} |

## Feature Dependencies

```
{dependency_diagram}
```

### Dependency Notes

- **{feature_a} requires {feature_b}:** {reason}
- **{feature_c} enhances {feature_d}:** {reason}
- **{feature_e} conflicts with {feature_f}:** {reason}

## MVP Definition

### Launch With (v1)

Minimum viable product -- what's needed to validate the concept.

- [ ] {feature} -- {why_essential}

### Add After Validation (v1.x)

Features to add once core is working.

- [ ] {feature} -- {trigger}

### Future Consideration (v2+)

Features to defer until product-market fit is established.

- [ ] {feature} -- {why_defer}

## Feature Prioritization Matrix

| Feature | User Value | Implementation Cost | Priority |
|---------|------------|---------------------|----------|
| {feature} | {value} | {cost} | {priority} |

**Priority key:**
- P1: Must have for launch
- P2: Should have, add when possible
- P3: Nice to have, future consideration

## Competitor Feature Analysis

| Feature | Competitor A | Competitor B | Our Approach |
|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| {feature} | {approach_a} | {approach_b} | {our_plan} |
