## Structure

```markdown
# Project Context

## Locked Decisions

{Technology choices, architecture decisions, and constraints that are NON-NEGOTIABLE.
 These MUST be honored by every plan and executor — no exceptions.}

| Decision | Rationale | Locked By |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| {e.g., "Use TypeScript"} | {User preference, team skill} | User |
| {e.g., "PostgreSQL via Supabase"} | {Existing infrastructure} | User |

## User Constraints

{Budget, timeline, skill level, hosting, team size — factors that shape planning}

- {e.g., "Solo developer, no team"}
- {e.g., "Deploy to Hetzner VPS"}
- {e.g., "Must work offline"}

## Deferred Ideas

{Features explicitly moved to v2 or out-of-scope. Plans MUST NOT include these.}

| Idea | Reason Deferred |
|------|----------------|
| {feature} | {reason} |

## Claude's Discretion Areas

{Areas where the planner can make implementation choices without asking the user.
 Document the choice made and rationale when exercised.}

| Area | Choice Made | Rationale |
|------|------------|-----------|
| {e.g., "State management library"} | {e.g., "Zustand"} | {e.g., "Lightweight, fits project size"} |
```

## Rules

- Locked decisions are immutable once set — only the user can change them
- Deferred ideas must NEVER appear in plans
- Discretion areas are documented when the planner exercises choice
- Phase-level CONTEXT.md files (in phase directories) override project-level for that phase
