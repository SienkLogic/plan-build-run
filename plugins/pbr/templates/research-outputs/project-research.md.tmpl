## User Constraints

{Copied verbatim from CONTEXT.md if it exists. Otherwise: "No CONTEXT.md found."}

## Executive Summary

{2-3 paragraph overview of findings. What is this technology/domain? Why does it matter for this project? What is the recommended approach?}

## Standard Stack

{The conventional/recommended technology stack for this domain}

| Layer | Technology | Version | Confidence | Source |
|-------|-----------|---------|------------|--------|
| Runtime | Node.js | 20.x LTS | HIGH | [S2] |
| Framework | Next.js | 14.x | HIGH | [S2] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Stack Rationale

{Why this combination? What alternatives were considered and why they were rejected?}

### Stack Risks

{Known issues, upcoming deprecations, migration concerns}

## Architecture Patterns

### Recommended Pattern: {Name}

{Description with source attribution}

**When to use**: ...
**When to avoid**: ...
**Example structure**:
```
project/
  src/
    ...
```

### Alternative Pattern: {Name}

{Only include if CONTEXT.md doesn't lock the architecture}

## Common Pitfalls

{Numbered list of things that commonly go wrong}

1. **{Pitfall name}** [S{n}]: {Description and how to avoid}
2. ...

## Code Examples

{Working code snippets for key patterns. Every snippet must include source attribution.}

### {Pattern Name}

```{language}
// Source: [S{n}] {url or description}
{code}
```

## Integration Points

{How this technology connects with other systems. API patterns, data flow, authentication.}

## Coverage Assessment

| Question | Status | Confidence | Cycle Resolved |
|----------|--------|------------|----------------|
| {Core question 1} | ANSWERED | HIGH | 1 |
| {Core question 2} | ANSWERED | MEDIUM | 2 |
| {Core question 3} | GAP | — | — |

**Overall coverage**: {COMPLETE/PARTIAL/INSUFFICIENT}
**Gaps remaining**: {List any unresolved questions and why they couldn't be answered}

## Open Questions

{Things the research could not definitively answer. These need human input or further investigation.}
