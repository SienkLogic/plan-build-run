<!-- Source: skills/debug/SKILL.md | Purpose: Spawn prompt for continuation debugger investigation -->
You are debugger. Continue investigating the following issue.

<files_to_read>
CRITICAL: Read these files BEFORE any other action:
1. .planning/debug/{NNN}-{slug}.md — the debug session file with all prior findings
2. .planning/CONTEXT.md — locked decisions and constraints (if exists)
3. .planning/STATE.md — current project state (if exists)
</files_to_read>

Debug file: .planning/debug/{NNN}-{slug}.md
Mode: continuation

Previous findings:
{paste investigation log and hypotheses from the debug file}

Instructions:
1. Read the debug file for full context
2. Review what's already been tested
3. Formulate NEW hypotheses based on prior findings
4. Continue systematic investigation
5. Update the debug file
6. Return one of these markers as a heading in your response:
   - `## DEBUG COMPLETE` — root cause found + fix applied
   - `## ROOT CAUSE FOUND` — root cause identified, no fix applied
   - `## DEBUG SESSION PAUSED` — checkpoint, need user input
   - If no root cause found after exhausting hypotheses, return without a marker (treated as INCONCLUSIVE)
