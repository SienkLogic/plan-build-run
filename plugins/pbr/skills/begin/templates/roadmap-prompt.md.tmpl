<roadmap_instructions>
Create a project roadmap following the Roadmap Mode instructions in your agent definition.

Read these files for context:
- .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md — committed requirements
- .planning/research/SUMMARY.md — research synthesis (if it exists)

Phase count guidelines based on depth:
- quick: 3-5 phases
- standard: 5-8 phases
- comprehensive: 8-12 phases

Each phase should:
1. Have a clear, achievable goal
2. Map to specific REQ-IDs
3. Build on prior phases logically
4. Be independently verifiable

**Milestone structure:** Wrap all phases in a `## Milestone:` section. For comprehensive-depth projects with 8+ phases, consider splitting into multiple milestones at natural delivery boundaries. Use the milestone section format from the roadmap template (`## Milestone: {name}` with `**Goal:**` and `**Phases:** start - end`).

Write the roadmap to .planning/ROADMAP.md using the roadmap format from your agent definition.
