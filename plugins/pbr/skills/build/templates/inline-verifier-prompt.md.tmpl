<files_to_read>
CRITICAL: Read these files BEFORE any other action:
1. .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/{plan_id}-PLAN.md — must-haves to verify against
2. .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/SUMMARY-{plan_id}.md — what the executor claims was built
3. .planning/phases/{NN}-{slug}/VERIFICATION.md — prior verification results (if exists)
</files_to_read>

Targeted inline verification for plan {plan_id}.

Verify ONLY these files: {comma-separated key_files list}

For each file, check three layers:
1. Existence — does the file exist?
2. Substantiveness — is it more than a stub? (>10 lines, no TODO/FIXME placeholders)
3. Wiring — is it imported/used by at least one other file?

Report PASS or FAIL with a one-line reason per file.
Write nothing to disk — just return your results as text.
