- Removed `.gitkeep` placeholder files from `cursor-pbr/` (replaced by real content)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- Token-saving CLI: 6 new commands in `towline-tools.js` — `frontmatter`, `must-haves`, `phase-info`, `state update`, `roadmap update-status`, `roadmap update-plans`
- Companion web dashboard (Express 5.x, EJS, Pico.css v2, HTMX 2.0) with overview, phase detail, roadmap, todos, and SSE live updates
- `/dev:import` skill — Import external plan documents into Towline format
- `/dev:note` skill — Zero-friction idea capture with promote-to-todo support
- `/dev:setup` skill — Interactive onboarding wizard for new installations
- `/dev:explore` skill — Socratic conversation for idea exploration
- `/dev:continue` skill — Execute the next logical step automatically
- `/dev:health` skill — Validate `.planning/` directory integrity
- General agent — Lightweight Towline-aware agent for ad-hoc tasks
- `/dev:build <N> --team` variant — Agent Teams for complex inter-agent coordination
- `/dev:review <N> --auto-fix` variant — Auto-diagnose and fix verification failures
- Hook spawn tests for all lifecycle hooks
- Iterative retrieval protocol for researcher agent
- Behavioral contexts for agent prompt refinement
- Published to npm with OIDC trusted publishing

### Changed
- Skill count increased from 15 to 21
- Agent count increased from 9 to 10 (added General agent)
- Hook scripts consolidated: Write/Edit dispatch reduced from 4 spawns to 2
- All hook scripts now use `logHook()` from `hook-logger.js` for unified logging
- Agents reference new CLI tooling shortcuts instead of manual YAML parsing
- README rewritten with badges, comparison table, and acknowledgments
- Package tarball trimmed from 1.9MB to 305KB via explicit `files` field

### Fixed
- Windows CI: `parseMustHaves` now trims CRLF line endings
- Context budget: main orchestrator no longer reads agent definitions (saves ~15% context)

- Status line ANSI rendering on Windows terminals

- Hook-enforced quality gates: commit validation, plan format checking, session state injection, pre-compact preservation
- Wave-based parallel execution via Task() subagents
- Goal-backward verification at phase and milestone levels
- Persistent file-based state management (.planning/ directory)
- Configurable workflow: depth, models, gates, parallelization, git branching
