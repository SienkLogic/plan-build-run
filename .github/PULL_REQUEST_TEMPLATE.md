<!--
  ⚠️  PR TITLE FORMAT REQUIRED — your PR will not merge without it!

  Your PR title MUST follow this format:
    {type}({scope}): {description}

  Examples:
    fix(tools): remove --local flag from Copilot install
    feat(tools): add dark mode to dashboard
    docs(planning): update roadmap with phase 4

  Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, chore
  Scopes: tools, planning, or a descriptive word

  WHY: Release-please uses the PR title to generate the changelog
  and version bumps. Non-conventional titles are silently ignored
  and your change won't appear in any release.
